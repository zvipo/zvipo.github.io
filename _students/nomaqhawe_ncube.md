I am a passionate public health professional with a Master of Public Health (MPH) from the University of Michigan â€“ Ann Arbor, specializing in Social and Behavioral Health Sciences and certified in Social Epidemiology.

My work focuses on advancing health equity, accessibility, and sustainable public health solutions. I bring hands-on experience in data analysis (R, SPSS, Excel), public health program development and evaluation, project management, budgeting, grant writing, and participant recruitment. I also have expertise in HIV/AIDS prevention, education, social determinants of health (SDoH), and brief behavioral interventions.

I am driven by a commitment to creating measurable, community-centered impact and am actively building a career that bridges public health, consulting, and sustainable development.
