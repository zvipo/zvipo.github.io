We welcome contributions of all kinds -- code, documentation, bug reports, and ideas.

## How to Contribute

1. **Find a project** -- Browse our [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/zvipo) and pick one that interests you.
2. **Check the issues** -- Look for issues labeled `good first issue` or `help wanted` for a good starting point.
3. **Fork and branch** -- Fork the repository, create a feature branch, and make your changes.
4. **Submit a pull request** -- Open a PR with a clear description of what you changed and why.

## Guidelines

- Follow the coding style and conventions already in the project.
- Write tests for new functionality where applicable.
- Keep pull requests focused -- one change per PR.
- Be respectful and constructive in all interactions.

## Reporting Issues

Found a bug or have a feature request? Open an issue on the relevant repository. Include as much detail as you can: steps to reproduce, expected behavior, and your environment.
