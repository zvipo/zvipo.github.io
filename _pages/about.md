**Zvipo** means "gifts" in Shona. We are a home for open-source projects built for the African ecosystem.

## Mission

We build and maintain open-source tools that address real needs across Africa -- from developer tooling to community infrastructure. Our work is done in the open, and we welcome contributors from everywhere.

## Values

- **Open by default** -- Our code, discussions, and decisions happen in public.
- **Community-driven** -- We build what communities need, guided by the people who use our tools.
- **Quality matters** -- We ship well-tested, well-documented software.
